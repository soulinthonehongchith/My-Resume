                Packwood Ski Project, Database class
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp; It was a group project with a team of five. The project requested us to create a database for a ski manufacturing company, Packwood Ski. In this project, we learned to collaborate all of what we have learned from the class into the project which ranges from drawing an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD), populating data, importing data to database and querying (SQL) for data to make a report.

            <p>
                &emsp; In my C# Programming class, we used GitHub as a place to store the C# code that we did in the class. This also includes the project and personal website for resume.
